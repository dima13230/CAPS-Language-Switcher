# CAPS Language Switcher

Replaces caps lock behavior in Windows. Now you can switch languages with single press of caps lock. To toggle caps mode press any shift and then caps ( right shift + caps is the most convenient)

## Requirements

Windows 10 (and probably earlier)

## How to use

1. Download and install release (or build from source)
1. Depending on case, there are two options:
  1. If you have downloaded and installed release, app will be added to autostart and ran automatically.
  1. If you have built it from source, you can move lswitch.exe file anywhere, launch it and add it to autostart (if you want to make it run on every boot)
1. That's it! It should work now. If you press CAPS LOCK, you will see how language layout changes. If you press shift + caps (either of shift) it will toggle caps mode.
